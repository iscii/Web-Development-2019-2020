Enhancements
    >XSalvo
        >X- X shots per turn, no resets on hit.
    XXMove a ship every time a ship is sunk
        - Moving ship would use same interface as setup
        - A shup that moves may not occupy any of the spaces that
        have already been called (?) by the opponent
        - A ship that moves has all its hits repaired.

    Self:
        >X - When selecting a ship, set its control to the box which the mouse is hovering over.
        XX- [probably difficult] When selecting a ship, keep its selected box position on mouseclick. store its control relative to the box that is clicked.
        XX- In default formation, if the cpu tracks vertically first (say, from b3)
        and then next turn it destroys Battleship, and later it randomizes
        to hit a box occupied by A, it will track A until it hits the box that
        was already hit by the B tracking and then randomize.
            - Make it so that when tracking and if target.hit, test for the cpuTarget/cpuTrackBox position + 2 instead of + 1 (once all + 1 tries are exhausted
            (to see if undefined or hit) and if not, hit it instead of randomizing.
