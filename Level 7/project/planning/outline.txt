        Setup
            - Ships begin in order from top to bottom, all defaulted horizontal
            - Players may move and rotate ships around the grid
                - Select the ship [onclick, client.target]
                - When a ship is selected:
                    - selected = true;
                    - it will follow the cursor.
                    - hovering over grids will expand it and highlight it in a different color
                    - pressing R will rotate the ship (from the angle of its furthest left and top grid)
                        - only two rotation forms: vertical (ex: A1 - E1) and horizontal (ex: A1 - A5)
            Start Button
                - Randomly arranges enemy ships [not visible to player]
                - Disables setup functions
                - Starts game functions
        Game
            - One player turn = one round
            - players, user, cpu
            Player Turn
                - click on enemy grid to attack it
                    - [normal] if you hit a ship you go again
                    - [salvo] you get 5 hits
                        - grid turns red if ship is it
                        - if not, grid turns white [blue to reflect water]
                        - if all the grids occupied by a ship are hit, the ship is sunk 
            Enemy Turn
                - choose a spot at random
                - if it hits or knows where a ship is, it will track the grid
                vertically or horizontally (coinflip) until it is sunk.
                    - if vertically and it hits, remain vertical. If miss on next turn,
                    skip to the opposite vertical end on next turn.
                    - if both misses, it will try horizontal until a ship is sunk.

        Victory

        - Moving ship would use same interface as setup
        - A shup that moves may not occupy any of the spaces that
        have already been called (?) by the opponent
        - A ship that moves has all its hits repaired.
