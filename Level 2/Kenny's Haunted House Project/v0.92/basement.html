			<h1>You have been die</h1>
			<br />
			<h2>You enter the basement, and feel a strange chill throughout your body. You notice
			a strange chanting coming from the bottom of the steps, and attempt to stealthily
			listen. There is a group of people worshiping a strange marking as well as a glowing
			book. Before you can escape, you are caught by the peculiar group, which hold you
			in place as a giant beast rises from the glowing book. A ray of light suddenly pierces
			the hearts of everyone in the room, as well as yours. You die instantly.</h2>
