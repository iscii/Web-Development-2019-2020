			<h1>A message to those who enter this house</h1>
			<h2>To whom it may concern,<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
			I have discovered a terrible secret lying in the history of this house. Whoever is reading this,
			you're not supposed to be here, you need to leave <span>NOW!</span> There is something hiding within
			the depths of this house. Tell NO ONE of whatever you may find here. This will just create upset in
			the town, and cause chaos, which CANNOT happen if I am to continue my research of the strange 
			happenings of this house. I will do my best to investigate the peculiar situation. Whatever
			you do, leave! The key to your escape lies in the main bedroom. The combination to the safe is
			provided below. Keep an eye out for "the painting" it's your <span>only hope!</span><br/><br/><br/><br/>
												- CA.
			<br/><br/>*Also, STAY AWAY FROM THE BASEMENT!       26-04-36
