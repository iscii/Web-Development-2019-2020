Event Storage
    onclick = react(event)
    react(e)
        if(array.length < 2)
            array.push(e)
        //and then compare the two events

Ship Grid Occupation:
    give the ships properties:
        - controller box [its left/top most box occupied - that's its core.] = grid object
        - grids occupied [array of grid objects] - depends on controller box
        - its occupied grids are the box# + 5 if horizontal
        - box letter + 5 if vertical
            Options:
                - substitute letters for numbers
                - array storing letters in order
                - array storing all the boxes, determine box occupations
                through arithmetic sequencing using the 'for' function
                    - + 1 for horizontal, + 5 for vertical
        
Box objects:
    - bool occupied
        - if true, ship object that occupies it
    - array id = [letter, number]
