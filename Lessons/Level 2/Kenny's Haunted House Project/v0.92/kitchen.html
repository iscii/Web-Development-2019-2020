			You arrive in the kitchen, which has a minimalistic design. It appears to be older that you might
			think, with subtle spiderwebs and dust populating the wood. There appears to be many cupboards that
			could hold clues, while there is also an entrance to the living room. In addition, there is an
			ancient-looking door that's locked in every possible way, which you feel a strange attaction towards.<br />
			What will you do?
