		<h1>Instruction</h1>
		<h2>Welcome to Haunted House!!</h2>
		<h3>
		<br /> <i>Goal:</i> Escape the haunted house! 
		<br /> There are some dangers in this house that might kill you! Try avoid such dangers, and keep safe, and try get out of the creepy house! 
		<br /><br /> There are some hidden hint through out your adventure. They will help you, but you don't necessarily have to find them.
		<br /><br /> 
		<i>How to navigate:</i> Below the story paragraph, there is several buttons that you can click to either <i> do an action </i> or <i> move on to other room.</i>
		<br /> <br />
		<i>These are some of the navigational button:</i>
		<br />
		<img src = "image/goDownStairs.png"/> Click this to go down one floor. <br />
		<img src = "image/goUpStairs.png"/> Click this to go up one floor.<br />
		<img src = "image/TurnLeft.png"/> Click this to turn left.<br />
		<img src = "image/turnRight.png"/>Click this to turn right.<br />
		<img src = "image/home.png"/>This will lead you to the Main Hall. (The first room that you see when you start playing)<br />
		<br /> Some of these buttons might not show in all of the rooms depending where you are. Also, other buttons other than these ones might also show up!
		<br /> <br /> 
		Other than these navigational button, there are action buttons. These ones might be or might not be on your screen depending on the story. I don't want to tell you what they are because it can be a spoiler!!
		<br />
		<br /> <i>Last tip:</i> Think carefully before doing an actions or moving on to other rooms.</h3>
