const FAQ = [{question:"When do I use a parameter?",answer:"When you need one.<br /><br />Parameters are a good reason to plan out your solution before coding it. When you sit down to write a function, you need to think about what that function needs to do and what information is necessary to that task. If there's any of that information missing, don't stop to look for it. Create a parameter to receive it. Most of the time, when you go to call that function, you will realize that that information is available."}, {question:"When do I use a return value?",answer:"When you need one.<br /><br />If your function manufactures a value, your instinct will be to store it in some global variable. Sometimes that's okay. The variable may be important to the program as a whole. But, if that value is important to the moment, just return it. Wherever the function is being called, that value will be returned and you can use it as necessary."}, {question:"Why do you keep saying, 'when you need one'?",answer:"One of the biggest pitfalls of learning program is approaching it incorrectly.

From there, you need to work out the solution. That's the step that often gets skipped.  Coding is easy if you know what you want to code.

Later, when you learn some advanced CSS, you'll see how to manipulate elements to display the way you want them to.",stepImage:"step2.png"},{stepText:"One of the nice things you can do with lists is nest them.  That is, make lists within lists.<br /><br />When you're nesting lists, you should consider how you want them to appear.  In the example below, I've used h4 tags to define the headings of each sub-list.  Since each sub-list is a list-item, it gets a number also.  Since h4 tags are block elements, they are on a different line as the number.<br /><br />It's pretty ugly.",stepImage:"step5.png"},{stepText:"If we change the list-style-type of the ul tags, we can eliminate the numbers and make the list look much better.<br /><br />We want to keep each sub-list as an li of the original list.

{tTitle:"Tables", objective:"Objective: To build some tables using HTML", tDescription:"Tables are another construct that's built by combining multiple tags together. They are used for pages that need to display data in an organized manner.<br /><br />Way back in prehistorice times, before CSS became the norm, Neanderthals used to lay out their web pages using tables. Table design was all the rage back then, but quickly fell out of favor as CSS provided better functionality.<br /><br />When designing your page using tables, things can get really complicated. You need tables inside of tables inside of tables. It's an ugly affair that confuses humans and puts extra stress on precessors.<br /><br />Don't do it.<br /><br />Tables are for data.<hr />",steps:[{stepText:"A table is built by using 3 tags.<br /><br />The <b>table</b> tag is the container for all things table.<br /><br />The <b>tr</b> tag, or the table row tag, defines a new row for the table.<br /><br />The <b>td</b> or table data tag is the container for the data stored in the cell.<br /><br />If you run the code shown (you should run the code shown), it won't look like very much.  It'll show all of the data, but there's no formatting so it may not really look like a table at all.",stepImage:"step1.png"},{stepText:"But, of course, that's why we have CSS. With complex tag structures, like a table, the question becomes what to style and how.<br /><br />We can add a border around the table with CSS borders.  CSS borders are composed of 3 properties:<br /><br />border-style, which can have values of none, dotted, dashed, solid, double, groove, ridge, inset, outset.<br /><br />border-width, which can be thin, medium, thick, or some number with a unit of measure (px, in, cm).<br /><br />border-color, which uses the standard methods for setting color.",stepImage:"step2.png"},{stepText:"Borders also have a shorthand:<br /><br />border:width, style, color;<br /><br />You can omit the color and it will default to black.<br /><br />You can also program different sides of your border by using the border-right, border-left, border-top, and border-bottom properties.  Those are shorthands, but you can get very specific by specifying side and property (border-right-style, border-top-color, border-bottom-width).",stepImage:"step3.png"},{stepText:"You may have noticed that, while styling the table tag puts a border around the table itself, it does nothing for the individual cells. If you want borders throughout the table, you need to style your td tags.",stepImage:"step4.png"},{stepText:"There are a couple of things you can do to dress up your table and make it easier to look at.<br /><br />If you want some space between your content and the cell borders, add padding.  Padding is coded very much like borders, except it's just a measurement.  It adds space around the content.  You can specify a side (padding-left, padding-right, padding-top, padding-bottom).<br /><br />You can also use a shorthand for padding where the values have meaning depending on how many you include.<br /><br />padding:top right bottom left<br /><br />paddding:top right&left bottom<br />padding:top&bottom right&left<br />padding:all",stepImage:"step5.png"},{stepText:"You can also bring those borders together to eliminate the spaces between cells using border-collapse:collapse.<br /><br />Note that this is programmed through the table tag. <br /><br />The reason is because the table has control of, and is aware of, all of its cells.  A single cell cannot collapse borders because it has not borders inside of itself.<br /><br />It's all about the hierarchy of elements.",stepImage:"step5.png"},{stepText:"Like everything else, your table is being built top-down.  That means that the browser is adding to the page as it sees your code.  There are only 2 cells in the first row.  When it gets to the 3rd cell in the second row, it has to expand the size of the table to fit the cell, but it's not going to go back up and install an empty cell.

The cells are stretched automatically, but by making them 15% of the width of the table, they are all stretched to an even width.<br /><br />Even though 15 * 6 doesn't equal 100%, the browser will account for the difference, leaving no empty space.  If you were to make them larger, however, you would have a problem because some of the cells would be bigger and the others would be smaller.",stepImage:"step12.png"},{stepText:"Let's get a little crazy.<br /><br />Let's make a runner down the side of the table that says 'MLB'.<br /><br />This is not enough.

We could use a while loop here, but we're counting.  For loops are better for counting.
