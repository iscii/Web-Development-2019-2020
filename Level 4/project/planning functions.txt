Functions
	checkIfPlayable()
		-When a player clicks a grid, call to check if the play is able to be made (grid is not locked or game is not over)
			-if array[gridCode];
				gridLock();
			else
				return;
		-If not playable, make sure no other functions are called and nothing changes.
		-If it is playable:
			-I feel like I can compact my code much more and not have to make a separate function for the check and the actual call.

		//Variable to hold in-row things
		-var Ro

		//start at the first grid, check the 4th and 7th grid for true. start at the second grid, check the 5th and 8th grid. start at the third grid, check the 6th and 9th grid
		//redo this: make a for function for the index start, and then another for function for the row/column/diagonal check. fuck lmao
