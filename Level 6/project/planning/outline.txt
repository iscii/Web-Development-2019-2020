Level 6 Project: Thirty One
    Blackjack

Functionality
    -Card Deck (Prototype class):
        -add cards to object, and then shuffle
            -can prob do both at once (pseudocode)
    -Start
        -Dealer chosen at random
        -Next player after dealer has first turn (if dealer is largest number, wrap)
        -shift the Card Deck 3x and push the returned value to the player's hand.
        
        -move top card of deck to discard pile (as first card of discard pile) to initiate it
            -Discard pile cards are visible.

    -Players
        -player class
            -ID#
            -Hand array
            -Strikes
        -player objects are created upon initial card deals
        -4 players (identified by numbers)
    -CPU
        -Knock: if hand's value > 24
        -Discard Pile: if doing so will increase value in its hand (based on suit?)
            -determineHandValue(parameter);
        -Draw: if no discard or knock.
        -Discarding: discard a card that will not decrease its hand value (of a minority suit)
            -or discard a card that will decrease its hand value by least amount (if all cards are of same suit)
            -If there are more than 1 card that satisfy the above requirement, the computer will always
            throw the lowest card unless it means breaking up a **pair of cards with the same value**
            -see spec sheet example
    -Moves
        -Draw
            -shift the card deck and push the returned value to the player's hand
        -Discard
            -shift the discard pile and push the returned value to the player's hand (psdc)
        -Knock 
            -Ends current player's turn.
        -Discarding
            -let player choose a card in hand to discard (add to top of deck)
    -Determine card value (psdc)
        -for each suite, add up the cards belonging to it (using class properties?)
        -face cards are worth 10, aces are worth 11

    -Rules
        -3 matching cards of the same value: score is 30
        -Two face cards and an ace: 31
            -end round and give every other player a strike
        -Reveal cards at end of round and tally
        -Strikes
            -Players with the lowest score recieve a strike
            -If the player with the lowest score knocked, they recieve two strikes.
            -Three strikes and the player is out

        -Knocking:
            -A knock may only occur once (Set knock = 1 and -- when a player knocks. add player.knock = true?)

        -For as long as the game is in play, after each round the dealer shifts to
        the next player clockwise (opposite of person who goes first in prev round)

        -If human player is eliminated, game proceeds unless player resets

        -If the remaining two players tie in the last round, 
        every player gets back a strike and eliminated players are back in the game.

Interface
    -Player hand perspective relative to real life (bottom of screen - p1)
    -CPUs left, right, and top (p2, p3, p4, respectively).
    -Cards (during the round) are shows as cardbacks.
        -Reveal cards upon round end
        -Card numbers shown will update according to number of cards in hand
            *-Display() each time a card is drawn or discarded.
    -Have a random delay for cpu discarding and knocking.
    
    -Display next to each player showing number of strikes (digital display looking thing?)
    -Knock button above p1's hand

    -Deck and Discard pile are in middle of screen
        -Deck in middle, Discard to left/right of deck.
        -Label them with mahjong-style table labeling (transparent white-gray box above the pile)
        -Discard pile cards are visible to players
            -Just make it so the top card is visible to player
        -In display (for hovering animation)
            -For the deck, show two cards overlayed over one another (so you only see one, but can see the other upon hovering)
            -For the discard pile, show the top two cards (discard[0] and [1]) overlayed over one another.

    -Drawing:
        -pull-card-from-deck transition/animation effect
            -When hovering, call animation. Top card slides downward
        -when clicked, make a "fall-into-hand animation" 
            appears out of thin air, uses reverse hand hover animation

    -Reset button

    -Typical gambling table (green, rough pattern, wooden edges)
    
    -Discarding:
        -Hovering over cards will extend them from the hand
