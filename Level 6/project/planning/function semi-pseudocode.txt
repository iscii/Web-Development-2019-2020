X9. round management
    either give it a small interval after each round till the next round, or
    let the user choose when the next round begins.
X10. Now, just work on the strike system and tallying. 
    X-Standard strikes
X11. And then do the deck reshuffle. 
X12. Also, simplify the user functions by putting them into the prototype functions.
X13. Head over to display and resetting.

every player gets back a strike and eliminated players are back in the game.
