        find suite and add it to total value

    compare values (maybe by sorting the array in which the values are put in or smtn)

ADDED 3/24/20
X6. knocking
X7. strikes and round management
X8. cpu choices and stuff 
ADDED 4/4/2020
X9. round management
    either give it a small interval after each round till the next round, or
    let the user choose when the next round begins.
X10. Now, just work on the strike system and tallying. 
    X-Standard strikes
X11. And then do the deck reshuffle. 
X12. Also, simplify the user functions by putting them into the prototype functions.
13. And then head over to display and resetting.
    Reset first
        Start game button -> when game is started, turn it to reset
            >when game is ended, turn it to start
    Display
14.check for 31 and when 31, end round and strike to all other players.
        -add this to initial dealing and then every turn thereafter.

-Completed round management, fixed bug where user could click before intervals were cleared.
-Rearranged the initialization functions, made more flexible.

4/11/2020
Currently: cleaning up for the day
Completed: [7:57PM] testing to see if deck reshuffling from discard works

4/17/2020
Currently: testing to see if strikes work properly
            -if player is out, do not deal them
Completed:  

            -strikes for player work
            -removed redudant code in discardCards
            -added prevention of player from actions without strikes
