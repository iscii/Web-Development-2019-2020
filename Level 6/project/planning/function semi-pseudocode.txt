ADDED 4/4/2020
X9. round management
    either give it a small interval after each round till the next round, or
    let the user choose when the next round begins.
X10. Now, just work on the strike system and tallying. 
    X-Standard strikes
X11. And then do the deck reshuffle. 
X12. Also, simplify the user functions by putting them into the prototype functions.
X13. Head over to display and resetting.

X14. Victory
X15 Check for 31 and when 31, end round and strike to all other players.
        -add this to initial dealing and then every turn thereafter.
X16. If the remaining two players tie in the last round, 
every player gets back a strike and eliminated players are back in the game.
