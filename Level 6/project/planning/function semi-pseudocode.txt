    Discard:
        if discardpile[0] + handvalue - hand[lowest value] > handvalue

>XdetermineHandValue(player, <optional parameter){
    for(var i = 0; i < player.cards.suites; i++){
        add up values 
    }
    if(optional parameter){
        find suite and add it to total value
    }
    compare values (maybe by sorting the array in which the values are put in or smtn)
    set total value to highest value

    return total value;
}
