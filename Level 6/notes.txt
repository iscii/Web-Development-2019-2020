Level 6, Lesson 5.11:
	-What is the point of initializing opList.innerHTML before the loop?
	-Answer: notice the = sign vs. the += sign in the loop. Without initializing in before the loop, you'll be +=ing (adding) the first values into the array,
		 so the first item of the array will be undefined. (This issue occured often in the fast food cashier code)
	Lesson 5.12 (issue)
	-There's an issue with the displayed code image. the conditional checks if something is = and not ==. Big mistake-o
