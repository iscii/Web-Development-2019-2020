determineHandValue's discard portion might have an issue - I think (i've forgotten lol it's been so long)
that it compares rank instead of value, so the cpu might discard an Ace and then pick it back up since
determineHandValue's draw portion actually factors in value. Which, in a 1v1, would end
up in an infinite loop of drawing an ace from the discard pileif both hands have the same suit
